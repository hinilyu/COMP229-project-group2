## Before starting to work

[Guide on using Git](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/practical-git-and-git-workflows/) <br />
Instead of working on main directly, please branch off of main into your own feature branch, and then merge those changes back into main.

```bash
  git checkout -b [your-feature]
```

### After finishing your work

- Push our local [your-feature] branch to origin (this creates a new branch on origin called origin/[your-feature])
- Merge origin/[your-feature] into origin/main on GitHub
- Pull down the new changes from origin/main into our local main
